# PYNQ-Support-Vector-Machines
This repository contains some Jupyter Notebooks files and overlays to interact with my project: SVM on PYNQ

Please download all files and put them onto the PYNQ board's SD card in the directory ".../jupyter_notebooks/PROJECT_FULL_DEMO/"

Simply run the cells in order to see the demo

This only works for PYNQ-Z2
